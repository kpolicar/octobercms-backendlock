# Why do I need this?
Are your clients using the back-end in a public or an otherwise unsecure environment? With Backend Lock, you can quickly lock the back-end session without losing any data (field values, cache, cookies, session, storage) by simply pressing a button in the main menu. Once you're ready to resume, re-enter the credentials to your account and continue with your work.

# Features
- Blends into OctoberCMS as if it were a native feature
- Adds a convenient button to the main menu to quickly lock the session
- Persists all of the data associated with the session
- Built with October - there are no external assets or dependencies

> **Compatible with OctoberCMS v2**
